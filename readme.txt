This project provides all the algorithms and test examples used in the paper "Fully distributed convex hull pricing based on alternating direction method of multipliers". The following is the main information of each file, the source program is runtest.m:
DP_UC: indicates the source code of the UC problem
DW: DW-CG method source code
OPT: The original method solves the convex hull pricing algorithm
ResearchWork: Convex hull pricing algorithm based on ADMM
